<p>Hey %recipient.first_name%,</p>

<p>Bob Dylan once wrote, The Times They Are a-Changinâ€™, and this time it's big. Each agency must defend their weakest agent (least amount of completed missions). If the weakest agent for the agency has been compromised, that team will lose an additional agent at random. If multiple agents are tied in last, they all count.</p>

<p>One more thing: The best agents in each agency will target the worst agents, and everyone else gets a new mission.</p>
