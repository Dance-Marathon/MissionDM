MissionDM
===========

MissionDM is based on the popular [Assassins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) game, a live action game where players are assigned a target to takedown with Silly Stringâ„¢.

Each game of MissionDM is played with multiple players targeting each other. The game continues until a chosen numbe of DM Agents are left standing!

This webapp is based on the original application by Matthew Gerstman, merely updated for usage by the Dance Marathon at the Univeristy of Florida organization.

You can checkout the original application at [playassassins.org](http://playassassins.org) and the original repository [here](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins).
